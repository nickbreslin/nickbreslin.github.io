# Welcome

### I build valuable software with talented people.

- I consider teambuilding to be one of the most important activities.
- I champion honest communication and feedback.
- I prefer proven, reliable technology over "Shiny New Things".
- I evaluate solutions based on business requirements.
- I minimizing cost and time, while ensuring quality and satisfaction.

## Philosophy

I am a follower of Marcus Aurelius, and the teachings of Stoicism.

I am a practioner of the Agile Manifesto and servant leader to my team members.

Trust and respect should be shared between team members and leadership structures.

## Passion for Education

I mentor junior developers (student workers) at Oregon State University on modern, accessible, responsive web development. We practice Agile project management (both Scrum and Kanban).

I have taught elementary and secondary school students in basic web development and game development.

I have supported and taught Agile inside and outside of my employment for over a decade. I am certified as an Agile Product Owner and Scrum Master by Scrum.org.
